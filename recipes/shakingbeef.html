        <h2>What is Shaking Beef?</h2>
            <p>
                Shaking beef or bò lúc lắc  is a French-inspired Vietnamese dish that consists of beef sauteed with cucumber, lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, pepper, and soy sauce. The beef is cut into small cubes the size of playing dice before being sauteed. Beef used to be a luxury ingredient, therefore the dish was mostly served at formal events, such as wedding banquets and anniversaries, however nowadays, it has become a common food. Before French colonization cows were only used for manual labour and were working animals.
